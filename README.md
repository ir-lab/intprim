# IntPrim
IntPrim is a Python Library for Interaction Primitives developed at the Interactive Robotics Lab at Arizona State University. Interaction Primitives (Ben Amor, 2014) provide a machine learning framework that allows users to learn controllers for human-robot interaction (HRI) from example demonstrations alone. This framework enables imitation learning in HRI settings in which two or more agents are physically interacting with each other. The overall objective is to extract the dynamics of an interaction from a set of example demonstrations, then use the dynamics to infer the future states of both the human and the robot. As a result IntPrim allows for a.) the prediction of future motions of a human partner, b.) the generation of appropriate robot reponses, and c.) the inference of latent (unobserved) variables that may be critical for the interaction. 

This library was primarily developed to enable training and inference with Bayesian Interaction Primitives (BIP), however, it also supports Probabilistic Movement Primitives and Particle Filters as a baseline for comparison.

This library has been successfully deployed in real-world HRI scenarios (some of which are shown above) involving cooperative object manipulation, shaking hands, hugging, grasping, and more!
A list of peer-reviewed publications that have utilized this library can be found below.

This library was created by Joseph Campbell, Simon Stepputtis, Michael Drolet, and Heni Ben Amor from Arizona State University.

A corresponding ROS package is available at https://github.com/ir-lab/intprim_framework_ros which greatly simplifies the process of setting up and running real experiments with the IntPrim library.
