    #   @param degree int The number of Sigmoid basis functions which will be uniformly distributed throughout the space.
    #   @param observed_dof_names array-like, shape (num_observed_dof, ). The names of all observed degrees of freedom.
    #   @param start_phase float The starting value from which the basis functions are uniformly distributed. The centers are calculated with linspace(start_phase, end_phase, degree).

    #   @param x array-like, shape(num_phase_values, ) or float. If array, a list of phase values for which to compute basis values. Otherwise, a single scalar phase value.
    #   @param degree int. Degree of this basis model.

    #   Gets the evaluations for the derivative of the basis functions for the given phase value(s).
    #   This is necessary for the computation of the Jacobian matrix in the EKF filter.
    #   Unlike get_basis_functions, this function does not (currently) implement a hash map internally and so re-computes values everytime.
    #   Since the basis decompositions are simple linear combinations, the partial derivative of the combination with respect to each weight is simply the partial derivative of a single basis function due to the sum rule.
    #
    #   This is the first order partial derivative with respect to x!
    #   It is used to compute the Jacobian matrix for filtering linear dynamical systems.
    #   Verified using wolfram alpha: d/dx a*(x-(1-x))^0 + b*(x-(1-x))^1 + c*(x-(1-x))^2 and d/dx a*(2x-1)^n

    #
