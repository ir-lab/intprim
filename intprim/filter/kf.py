##
#   The KalmanFilter class localizes an interaction in space via the extended Kalman filter.
#   Temporal localization is accomplished explicitly with an external time-alignment algorithm such as Dynamic Time Warping.
#   This class is a recursive filter, meaning it maintains state information between successive calls to localize().
#   As a spatial filter, the KalmanFilter's internal state consists of only B dimensions modeling the latent space of the interaction.
#   This class corresponds to a standard Probabilistic Movement Primitive.

    #   This method performs localization of space (basis weights).
    #   This is a recursive call, which means it updates the internal state estimate based on the given observations.
    #   For each observation given, two steps are performed recursively:
    #   First, the current state is propagated forward in time in what is known as the prediction step.
    #   $$ \\begin{align}
    #   \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t|t-1} &=
    #   \\boldsymbol{G}$
    #   \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t-1|t-1},\\
    #   %

    #   \\boldsymbol{Q}_t,
    #   \\end{align} $$
    #   In practice, the prediction does nothing for spatial filters because basis weights are time invariant.
    #
    #   Next, we integrate the observations into the current state in the update step.
    #   $$ \\begin{align}
    #   \\boldsymbol{K}_t &= \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{t|t-1} \\boldsymbol{H}_t^{T} (\\boldsymbol{H}_t \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{t|t-1} \\boldsymbol{H}_t^{T} + \\boldsymbol{R}_t)^{-1},\\
    #   %
    #   \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t|t} &= \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t|t-1} + \\boldsymbol{K}_t(\\boldsymbol{y}_t - h(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t|t-1})),\\
    #   %
    #   \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{t|t} &= (I - \\boldsymbol{K}_t \\boldsymbol{H}_t)\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{t|t-1},
    #   \\end{align} $$
    #
    #   Lastly, the mean and covariance of the state are returned.
