##
#   The ExtendedKalmanFilter class localizes an interaction in time and space via the extended Kalman filter.
#   This class is a recursive filter, meaning it maintains state information between successive calls to localize().
#   As with the other spatiotemporal filters, the ExtendedKalmanFilter's internal state consists of (N+1) dimensions modeling
#   the N-th order phase system plus B dimensions modeling the latent space of the interaction for a total size of N+1+B.
#   This class corresponds to a Bayesian Interaction Primitive.

    ##
    #   The initialization method for the ExtendedKalmanFilter. Responsible for initializing the state.
    #
    #   @param basis_model The basis model corresponding to this state space.
    #   @param initial_phase_mean Vector of dimension N corresponding to the initial mean of the constant velocity phase system. If this is a 0th order system, should contain only [phase_mean]. If this is 1st order, should contain [phase_mean, phase_velocity]. If this is 2nd order, should contain [phase_mean, phase_velocity, phase_acceleration]. Anything above 2nd order is not supported.
    #   @param initial_phase_var Vector of dimension N corresponding to the diagonal of the initial covariance of the constant velocity phase system. If this is a 0th order system, should contain only [phase_var]. If this is 1st order, should contain [phase_var, phase_velocity_var]. If this is 2nd order, should contain [phase_var, phase_velocity_var, phase_acceleration_var]. Anything above 2nd order is not supported.
    #   @param proc_var The process noise of the constant velocity phase system. This is a scalar value corresponding to the variance of a piecewise white noise model.
    #   @param mean_basis_weights Vector of dimension D containing the initial state for the basis weights.
    #   @param cov_basis_weights Matrix of dimension D x D containing the initial covariance matrix for the basis weights.
    #   @param time_delta The amount of time that elapses between time steps. This serves as a scaling factor to the constant velocity phase system. In most cases, this should be set to 1.0.
    #   @param cyclical Indicates whether this is a cyclical primitive. If True, the internal phase state will cycle back to 0 once it exceeds 1, allowing for continuous inference of periodic interactions.

    #   This method performs simultaneous localization of both time (phase) and space (basis weights).
    #   This is a recursive call, which means it updates the internal state estimate based on the given observations.
    #   For each observation given, two steps are performed recursively:
    #   First, the current state is propagated forward in time in what is known as the prediction step.
    #   $$ \\begin{align}
    #   \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t|t-1} &=
    #   \\boldsymbol{G}$
    #   \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t-1|t-1},\\
    #   %

    #   \\boldsymbol{Q}_t,
    #   \\end{align} $$
    #   Note that in this case, we only apply the dot product to the first N+1 dimensions of the state. This is for computational efficiency as only the constant velocity phase system has a non-zero transition.
    #
    #   Next, we integrate the observations into the current state in the update step.
    #   $$ \\begin{align}
    #   \\boldsymbol{K}_t &= \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{t|t-1} \\boldsymbol{H}_t^{T} (\\boldsymbol{H}_t \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{t|t-1} \\boldsymbol{H}_t^{T} + \\boldsymbol{R}_t)^{-1},\\
    #   %
    #   \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t|t} &= \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t|t-1} + \\boldsymbol{K}_t(\\boldsymbol{y}_t - h(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{t|t-1})),\\
    #   %
    #   \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{t|t} &= (I - \\boldsymbol{K}_t \\boldsymbol{H}_t)\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{t|t-1},
    #   \\end{align} $$
